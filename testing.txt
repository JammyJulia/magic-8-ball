Happy path:
-User writes '/ask Will i get a perfect grade?', bot responds with: 'Without a doubt' and adds that to history
-User writes '/add idk.', bot responds with: 'New answer succesfully added' and adds the answer to the users answer list

Use cases:
-User asks a questions, receives first answer, then rerolls for another answer and tries to reroll again, bot responds: 'You have already rerolled on this question'
-User writes '/ask Should i go to bed now? Its 1 am. ', bot responds with: 'Ask again later' and adds that to history
-User writes 'remove' the bot doesnt respond.
-User writes '/history' before having asked any question, bot responds with: 'You dont have any history yet'

Edge cases:
-User sends command '/ask' without providing a question, bot responds: 'No question provided'
-User uses command '/remove' multiple times, selecting every answer and ending up with an empty answer list, then writes '/ask haha got you' the bot responds: 'Answer list is empty, add to it using /add [answer]'
-User writes command '/add Yes ofc' 30 times, then writes '/ask am i the best?' and the bot still responds: 'My reply is no'
-User sends command '/ask ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥', bot responds: 'Meow'
