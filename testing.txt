Happy path:
-User writes '/ask Will i get a perfect grade?', bot responds with: 'Without a doubt' and adds that to history
-User writes '/add idk.', bot responds with: 'New answer succesfully added' and adds the answer to the users answer list

Use cases:
-User asks a questions, receives first answer, then rerolls for another answer and tries to reroll again, bot responds: 'You have already rerolled on this question'
-User writes '/ask Should i go to bed now? Its 1 am. ', bot responds with: 'Ask again later' and adds that to history
-User writes 'remove' the bot doesnt respond.
-User writes '/history' before having asked any question, bot responds with: 'You dont have any history yet'

Edge cases:
-User sends command '/ask' without providing a question, bot responds: 'No question provided'
-User uses command '/remove' multiple times, selecting every answer and ending up with an empty answer list, then writes '/ask haha got you' the bot responds: 'Answer list is empty, add to it using /add [answer]'
-User writes command '/add Yes ofc' 30 times, then writes '/ask am i the best?' and the bot still responds: 'My reply is no'
-User sends command '/ask ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥', bot responds: 'Meow'








*Will remove later:
Specification:
- Users can ask questions and receive answers from a predefined or custom list of responses.
- Users can reroll for a different answer for the most recent question.
- Users can add custom answers to their list of potential responses.
- Users can remove custom answers from their list.
- Program saves each round to history, also keeping track if it was rerolled and adding the new answer as well.
- Users can view the last 10 questions they asked and their respective answers. 
Output Display:
- After the /ask command, displays a shuffling animation before showing the answer.
- After the /add command, sends a message stating that the action was complete.
- After the /remove command,  displays a message stating that the action was complete.
- After /history command, desplays the last 10 rounds which include the rerolls
Input and output examples:
- Input: /ask will tomorrow be a good day?
- Output: *shuffling animation* , then  â€˜Without a doubtâ€™

Iterations:
1. Constructing main tasks of the bot like randomized answers, adding/removing from answer list
2. Implementing JSON database to store the history of each users rounds and custom answers.
